# MiCADO - autoscaling framework for Docker services on Cloud

This software is developed by the [COLA project](https://project-cola.eu/).

MiCADO is an auto-scaling framework for Docker applications. It supports autoscaling at two levels. At virtual machine (VM) level, a built-in Docker Swarm cluster is dynamically extended or reduced by adding/removing docker nodes hosted on cloud virtual machines. At container level, the number of replicas implementing a Docker Service is automatically increased/decreased. The application detailing the services, links and scaling rules must be specified by a TOSCA description.
